\usage{
ds.tidy_fill(
  df.name = NULL,
  newobj = NULL,
  fix_class = "ask",
  fix_levels = "ask",
  datasources = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df.name}{Name of the input DataFrame to fill.}

\item{newobj}{Name of the new DataFrame object created after filling.}

\item{fix_class}{Character, determines behaviour if class of variables is not the same in all
studies. Option "ask" (default) provides the user with a prompt asking if they want to set the
class across all studies, option "no" will throw an error if class conflicts are present.}

\item{fix_levels}{Character, determines behaviour if levels of factor variables is not the same
in all studies. Option "ask" (default) provides the user with a prompt asking if they want to set
the levels of factor variables to be the same across all studies, whilst option "no" will throw
an error if factor variables do not have the same class.}

\item{datasources}{Data sources from which to aggregate data. Default is \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
The filled DataFrame with added columns and adjusted classes or factor levels.
}
\description{
This function fills a given DataFrame by adding missing columns, ensuring consistent column classes, and adjusting factor levels where necessary.
It performs checks to detect class and factor level conflicts and prompts the user for decisions to resolve these conflicts.
