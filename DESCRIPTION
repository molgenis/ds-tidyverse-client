Description: Implementation of selected 'Tidyverse' functions within 'DataSHIELD', an open-source federated analysis solution in R. Currently, 'DataSHIELD' contains very limited tools for data manipulation, so the aim of this package is to improve the researcher experience by implementing essential functions for data manipulation, including subsetting, filtering, grouping, and renaming variables. This is the clientside package which should be installed locally, and is used in conjuncture with the serverside package 'dsTidyverse' which is installed on the remote server holding the data. For more information, see <https://www.tidyverse.org/>, <https://datashield.org/> and <https://github.com/molgenis/ds-tidyverse>.
